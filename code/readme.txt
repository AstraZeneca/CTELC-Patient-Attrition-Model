Patient attrition, also referred to as dropout or patient withdrawal, occurs when patients enrolled 
in a clinical trial either withdraw or are lost to follow-up by the clinical site and trial sponsor.

This folder contains the data files that were used in the analysis. The file descriptions are listed below:

|--code
    |
    |---- readme.txt:  readme file for the data folder
    |
    |
    |---- 2_Model_Code.R: This is the main modeling R code that is developed to perform the random forest predictive model. It uses the 	  
    |                        Indexed_Analysis_Ready.csv file from the data/raw folder for model  
    |                        and for the generation of charts and statistics. This file can be opened and executed from 
    |                        the in the RStudio by setting the appropriate working directory path to the 'raw' folder 
    |                        of this package
    |
    |---- 2_Model_Code.ipynb: This file contains R code run on Anaconda instance/Jupyter notebook, this is similar to the code " 2_Model_Code.R"
								the output of both codes will remain the same.
